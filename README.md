# Beecrowd Exercises in Java

This repository contains my solutions to various programming challenges from the [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) platform. All solutions are implemented in **Java**.

## 📌 About
Beecrowd (formerly URI Online Judge) is a competitive programming platform that offers a wide range of algorithmic problems. This repository serves as a personal archive of my progress and learning.

## 📁 Repository Structure
The solutions are organized in separate files based on problem numbers or categories. Each file follows the format:
```
📂 src/
   ├── B1001.java  // Solution to problem 1001
   ├── B1002.java  // Solution to problem 1002
